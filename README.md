# e-Bajaar-Shopping
A shopping website
Hello dear friends,
I made one more repository regarding an online shopping website as I was learning PHP along with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I know there are lots of scope to make this website very prompt and responsive but this was just a practice website for increasing my coding skills.
It took one week to make it from the scratch and no readymade framework is used here.
I am still working on this website, and going to do following things:-
  1. Making the backend part fully dynamic so that the seller can add, update, remove and maintain the information of his product.
  2. Making the look and feel more soothing to eyes, not so much make-up thing but a really attractive one.
  3. Validations and removing redundancies.
  
Apart from that if you can suggest any improvement, I would love know.
Thank you.
